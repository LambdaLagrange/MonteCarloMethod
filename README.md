# MonteCarloMethod

This program is to use random points that will fall inside the area of a circle. The percentage, when using a larger number, will become closer and close to the digits of PI.

Similar to the Pythagorean identity, the radius of the circle is x raised to the second, along with y raised to the second, and finding the sum of the numbers.

Next, using a look for the number of iterations that the user input into the console. The loop is keeping track of a counter. The counter will only go up if the number is less than or equal to 1.

Finally, using a formula, the random numbers that are less than one are divided by the counter. Then that number is multiplied by 4. 

The larger the number of random numbers, the closer the decimal point matches the digits of PI.
